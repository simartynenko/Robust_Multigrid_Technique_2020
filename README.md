# Book S.I.Martynenko "Sequential Software for the Robust Multigrid Technique", Triumph, Moscow, 2020 (File: ???.pdf)
This book covers sequential software for the Robust Multigrid Technique (RMT) and presents basic concepts of modern numerical methods for mathematical modeling of physical and chemical processes in the computational continuum mechanics (thermal conductivity, chemical hydrodynamics, convective heat transfer, electrodynamics, etc.). FORTRAN language subroutines for solving the boundary value problems of the computational continuum mechanics by point and block Seidel method (Vanka-type smoother) are given in Chapters 1-4. The multigrid module RMT_3D_2020 is described in detail in Chapter 2 of this book. The module contains subroutines for implementation of the problem-independent components of the Robust Multigrid Technique for solving the three-dimensional boundary value problems. Examples of the multigrid module RMT_3D_2020 application in static and dynamic cycles are given in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter «Short history of RMT» represents the historical development of the Robust Multigrid Technique. 
Potential readers are graduate students and researchers working in applied and numerical mathematics as well as multigrid practitioners and software programmers for modeling physical and chemical processes in aviation and space industries, power engineering, chemical technology and other branches of mechanical engineering.

S.I.Martynenko "The Robust Multigrid Technique: For Black-Box Software", de Gruyter, Berlin, 2017 (https://www.degruyter.com/view/title/527481)

This book presents a detailed description of a robust pseudomultigrid algorithm for solving (initial-)boundary value problems on structured grids in a black-box manner. To overcome the problem of robustness, the presented Robust Multigrid Technique (RMT) is based on the application of the essential multigrid principle in a single grid algorithm. It results in an extremely simple, very robust and highly parallel solver with close-to-optimal algorithmic complexity and the least number of problem-dependent components. Topics covered include an introduction to the mathematical principles of multigrid methods, a detailed description of RMT, results of convergence analysis and complexity, possible expansion on unstructured grids, numerical experiments and a brief description of multigrid software, parallel RMT and estimations of speed-up and efficiency of the parallel multigrid algorithms, and finally applications of RMT for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
